              Traveling by air spews more greenhouse gas than traveling by car. To help put this in perspective, a single round-trip flight across the U.S. produces roughly 2 tons of carbon dioxide per person, which equals about 10 percent of a U.S. citizen’s annual carbon footprint. If you can fly less often, it’s an effective way to reduce your carbon footprint.
